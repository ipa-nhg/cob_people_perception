1. Start the openni camera driver:
roslaunch cob_people_detection openni.launch

2. Start the face detector and people detector/tracker server:
roslaunch cob_people_detection people_detection.launch
(roslaunch cob_people_detection nodelet_manager.launch as well if not included in people_detection.launch)

3. Start the face detector action client interface:
rosrun cob_people_detection people_detection_client

3.1. Training with 1 in gui on the first time of usage.
-> Visualization of face detections with
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/cob_people_detection/face_detection/face_detection_image

3.2. Detection - enable face detection with 2 in the menu. 
-> Visualization with 
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/cob_people_detection/face_detection/face_detection_image   (that is the intermediate result)
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/cob_people_detection/people_detection_image      (this is the final person detection with name tag)

4. Service Call with people location response
rosservice call /cob_people_detection/detect_people



roslaunch cob_people_detection people_detection.launch

rosrun cob_people_detection people_detection_client 
	-choose (1) and press c to capture a new face
	-choose (2) to recognise a face that is already in the directory

The images are saved in /cob_people_perception/cob_people_detection/common/files/windows/TrainingData/. (as .bmp and there are also 2 xml files)
 
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/cob_people_detection/face_detection/face_detection_image  

rosrun image_view image_view image:=/cob_people_detection/people_detection_image 

if you call the service rosservice call /cob_people_detection/detect_people the id of the face is people_list/detections/label
